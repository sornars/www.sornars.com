I've thrown this blog together to try and get into the habit of writing more often. I'm hoping to cover a wide range of topics with a focus on progamming, the internet and technology. For instance, this blog was conceived and created over the course of a single evening. In that time I accomplished the following:

- Registered my first domain (this one here!) and signed up for some web hosting
- Installed Pelican, a static site generator built in Python and modified the dev-random2 theme
- Learned markdown (well that one was easy; I pretty much just started typing)
- Wrote this blog post

I'll be talking some of the above in greater depth in future posts, stay tuned for further updates.
