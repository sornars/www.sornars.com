Advice often given to people looking to gain experience in the world of data science is to grab an interesting data set and to start working on it. While there are interesting data sets all over the Internet such as those found at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) or those from your local government eg. [Canada](http://open.canada.ca/en/open-data), [United Kingdom](http://data.gov.uk/data/search) or [United States](http://www.data.gov/); it is helpful to get a bit of structure when first starting out. Enter [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com).

Kaggle has a ton of entry level competitions which will help you get acquainted with the basics of machine learning. The current competition on the [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) is aimed at complete beginners and has a great series of tutorials that guide you through some of the questions you need to ask yourself when working on a machine learning problem. 

One very valid criticism of Kaggle is that the competitions they hold focus on a very small subset of a data scientist's role: namely feature engineering and model validation. The truth is acquiring meaningful data sets and defining a problem to address are the far more challenging aspects of working in this space. Kaggle provides you with mostly clean data and a well defined problem that is often reduced to optimizing a single metric. While Kaggle competitions may not reflect real world data science particularly closely, they do provide you with the opportunity to develop your skills in a fun environment. 

A word of caution: be sure to look into correctly cross validating your fidings and don't try and optimise your model to the test set. The top of the leaderboard often reflects overfitting of the data and so I wouldn't recommend wasting too much time trying to gain that extra 0.0001% of accuracy to gain the top spot. Real data science is concerned with providing actionable insight - if your model is accurate enough to be useful then you're on the right track.
